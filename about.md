Graduate in 2017. Now is a Web programmer, works for [DXY.com](https://DXY.com).

`Love compuuter games`. When I was 6, my friend had a NES ([Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)), that was and is an amazing toy. Two of the most impressive game are Contra and Bomberman.

`Love programming`.I made first program at 12. One day, I was exploring my PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), then I found there was a Basic interpreter in it(of course, I didn't know it was called "interpreter"). When I run my first sample program, I was so excited. I used to write a program that can calculate π. Many years later, It was can't used anymore completely. I am regret I didn't keep it.

`Games + Programming => Love computer`. I like everything about computer.

Now my goal is to pass the IELTS test, and go to the US to further my education.

A further goal: Financial freedom.

A further further goal: Playing.（[Just for fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds#Bibliography)）。
