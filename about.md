Graduated in 2017, works for [DXY.com](https://DXY.com).

`Love compuuter games`. When I was 6, my friend had a NES ([Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)), that was and is an amazing toy. Two of the most impressive games are Contra and Bomberman.

`Love programming`.I made first program at 12. One day, I was exploring my PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), then I found there was a Basic interpreter in it(of course, I didn't know it was called "interpreter"). When I run my first sample program, I was so excited. I used to write a program that can calculate Ï€. Many years later, It was can't used anymore completely. I am regret I didn't keep it.
